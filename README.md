# Star Wars

## How to Run:
- Go to https://github.com/marianamend3s/SW
- Click on the Code green button and clone or download the project
- Open the project with XCode
- Run the project

## Post-delivery improvements:
After the delivery date I continued to improve some bits of the app. Those changes are on this [branch](https://github.com/marianamend3s/SW/tree/post-delivery-improvements), and available on this [PR](https://github.com/marianamend3s/SW/pull/1).

## API:
That API link on the requirements wasn't available (https://swapi.co), so I used this API instead: https://swapi.info

## XCode:
Version 14.2 (14C18)

## Architecture:
This is a simple app, and I started with a MVVM architecture, and then changed it to a MVVM-C architecture.

## TODOs:
I didn't complete the app with all API info and, also, app development relies on continuous improvement.
Here's a list of some of my TODOs:

- Add every API cateogory and properties to the app
- Make object properties and objects optional
- Reuse duplicated code 
- Add placeholders to ALL cells
- Make more unit tests
- Make UI tests
- Put the colors into Assets
- Add images to make the app more interesting
- Make the app adapt to other device orientations and to iPad.
